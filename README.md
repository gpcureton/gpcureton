### Hi there 👋
You won't find a lot here, most of my development is on my <a href="https://gitlab.ssec.wisc.edu/geoffc">GitLab</a> account for work,
or my personal <a href="https://codeberg.org/gpcureton">Codeberg</a> account.
Here is the link to my <a rel="me" href="https://mstdn.social/@gpcureton">Mastodon</a> account.
