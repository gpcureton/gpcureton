### Hi there 👋
This account only exists to interact with other GitHub accounts, you won't find any of my actual work here.

Most of my development is on my <a href="https://gitlab.ssec.wisc.edu/geoffc">GitLab</a> account for work,
or my personal <a href="https://codeberg.org/gpcureton">Codeberg</a> account.

My <a rel="me" href="https://mstdn.social/@gpcureton">Mastodon</a> account if anyone cares about that sort of thing.
